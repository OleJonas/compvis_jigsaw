DISCLAIMER

This code is HEAVILY inspired by R. Islam's implementation due to the SIFT method being quite involved and maths heavy. This project focuses mainly on increasing my understanding of the SIFT algorithm and being able to apply it to a problem of my choosing.  

The code I am basing much of this on can be found over at Islam's Github:
        https://github.com/rmislam/PythonSIFT/blob/master/pysift.py

Alot of the code here can be very similar as I have followed his guide for SIFT implementation in python.
